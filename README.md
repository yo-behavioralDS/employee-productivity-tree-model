# Predicting Employee Productivity Using Tree Models ðŸŒ²
This project explores the **Productivity Prediction of Garment Employees** dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, applying **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** models to predict employee productivity.


## Objectives
The aim of this project is to analyze and predict productivity levels among garment factory employees using tree-based machine learning models.  

## Datasets
- UCI Machine Learning Repository

## Libraries Used
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Methodology
1. **Dataset Exploration** â€” explored the dataset structure, checked column types, and summarized key variables to understand the data context.  
2. **Data Cleaning I & II** â€” handled missing values, corrected data types, removed duplicates, and ensured consistent formatting.  
3. **Tree Model Development** â€” built and tuned a Decision Tree and Random Forest classifier to predict productivity categories.  
4. **Visualization** â€” visualized the trained Decision Tree model. 
5. **Evaluation I & II** â€” assessed model accuracy, confusion matrix, calculated Precision, Recall, & F1 Score, and consistency.
6. **Communicating Model Insights** â€” interpreted model outputs, provided clear guidelines on how to read and understand the tree structure, and walked through a hypothetical example to demonstrate how predictions could be applied in a real-world context.

## Results & Interpretations
The Decision Tree visualization revealed that **'Incentive'** (financial motivation offered) was the most significant predictor of team productivity. The second most important factor was **'SMV'** (Standard Minute Value), which represents the time allocated for a given task.

## Conclusions
These findings imply that improving incentive structures and optimizing task scheduling could meaningfully enhance employee productivity within garment manufacturing teams.
